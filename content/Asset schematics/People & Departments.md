# 👤 People & Departments
> [!ABSTRACT] Scope
> This schema manages the human and organizational layer of the IT architecture. It combines automated identity data from **EntraID** with manual metadata for **Skills** and **Team** assignments.
---
## 🏗️ Object Type Hierarchy
### 1. Identity (Automated via EntraID)
- **People**: Individual user records (Name, Email, Employee ID).
- **Departments**: Org units (e.g., Engineering, Finance, HR).
    - *Reference:* People link to Departments via `Member Of`.
### 2. Capabilities & Collaboration (Manual for now)
- **Teams**: Cross-functional or project-based squads.
- **Skills**: Specific technical proficiencies (e.g., "AQL," "AWS Networking").
    - *Note:* These remain manual until the **Rovo Teamwork Graph** transition.
---
## 🛠️ Configuration & AQL Strategy
> [!INFO] Transition to Rovo
> These manual objects act as placeholders. Maintain strict naming conventions (e.g., "Team - [Name]") to ensure a clean data migration once the Teamwork Graph is live.
